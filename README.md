# mongo_utube_comments_database
"U-TUBE-API-COMMENT-DATABASE" Version 1.0.0

This bot will help you collect the viewers\' comments from any YouTube video
of your choosing. All you need to do is provide a YouTube video link and the script
will fetch the top 65 comments for you, as well as the authors\' names, the number
of likes for each comment and the date each comment was published. The bot will then save
these details to your Mongo Database Atlas account. You can then query this database in the
command prompt / terminal.

Cheers!
